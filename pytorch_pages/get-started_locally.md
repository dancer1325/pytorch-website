Start Locally
Select your preferences and run the install command. Stable represents the most currently tested and supported version of PyTorch. This should
   be suitable for many users. Preview is available if you want the latest, not fully tested and supported, builds that are generated nightly.
   Please ensure that you have
met the prerequisites below (e.g., numpy)
,  depending on your package manager. You can also
install previous versions of PyTorch
. Note that LibTorch is only available for C++.
NOTE:
Latest Stable PyTorch requires Python 3.10 or later.

Installing on macOS
PyTorch can be installed and used on macOS. Depending on your system and GPU capabilities, your experience with PyTorch on macOS may vary in terms of processing time.
Prerequisites
macOS Version
PyTorch is supported on macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or above.
Python
It is recommended that you use Python 3.10 - 3.14.
You can install Python either through
Homebrew
or
the
Python website
.
Package Manager
To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use the supported package manager:
pip
.
pip
Python 3
If you installed Python via Homebrew or the Python website,
pip
was installed with it. If you installed Python 3.x, then you will be using the command
pip3
.
Tip: If you want to use just the command
pip
, instead of
pip3
, you can symlink
pip
to the
pip3
binary.
Installation
pip
To install PyTorch via pip, use the following command, depending on your Python version:
# Python 3.x
pip3
install
torch torchvision
Verification
To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.
import
torch
x
=
torch
.
rand
(
5
,
3
)
print
(
x
)
The output should be something similar to:
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
Building from source
For the majority of PyTorch users, installing from a pre-built binary via a package manager will provide the best experience. However, there are times when you may want to install the bleeding edge PyTorch code, whether for testing or actual development on the PyTorch core. To install the latest PyTorch code, you will need to
build PyTorch from source
.
Prerequisites
[Optional] Install
pip
Follow the steps described here:
https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source
You can verify the installation as described
above
.
Installing on Linux
PyTorch can be installed and used on various Linux distributions. Depending on your system and compute requirements, your experience with PyTorch on Linux may vary in terms of processing time. It is recommended, but not required, that your Linux system has an NVIDIA or AMD GPU in order to harness the full power of PyTorch’s
CUDA
support
or
ROCm
support.
Prerequisites
Supported Linux Distributions
PyTorch is supported on Linux distributions that use
glibc
>= v2.28, which include the following:
Arch Linux
, minimum version 2020.01.22
CentOS
, minimum version 8
Debian
, minimum version 10.0
Fedora
, minimum version 24
Mint
, minimum version 20
OpenSUSE
, minimum version 15
PCLinuxOS
, minimum version 2014.7
Slackware
, minimum version 14.2
Ubuntu
, minimum version 20.04 (please note that 20.04 reached EOL)
The install instructions here will generally apply to all supported Linux distributions. An example difference is that your distribution may support
yum
instead of
apt
. The specific examples shown were run on an Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
Python
Python 3.10-3.14 is generally installed by default on any of our supported Linux distributions, which meets our recommendation.
Tip: By default, you will have to use the command
python3
to run Python. If you want to use just the command
python
, instead of
python3
, you can symlink
python
to the
python3
binary.
However, if you want to install another version, there are multiple ways:
APT
Python website
If you decide to use APT, you can run the following command to install it:
sudo
apt
install
python
Package Manager
To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use the supported package manager:
pip
.
pip
Python 3
While Python 3.x is installed by default on Linux,
pip
is not installed by default.
sudo
apt
install
python3-pip
Tip: If you want to use just the command
pip
, instead of
pip3
, you can symlink
pip
to the
pip3
binary.
Installation
pip
No CUDA
To install PyTorch via pip, and do not have a
CUDA-capable
or
ROCm-capable
system or do not require CUDA/ROCm (i.e. GPU support), in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and Compute Platform: CPU.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.
With CUDA
To install PyTorch via pip, and do have a
CUDA-capable
system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and the CUDA version suited to your machine. Often, the latest CUDA version is better.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.
With ROCm
To install PyTorch via pip, and do have a
ROCm-capable
system, in the above selector, choose OS: Linux, Package: Pip, Language: Python and the ROCm version supported.
Then, run the command that is presented to you.
Verification
To ensure that PyTorch was installed correctly, we can verify the installation by running sample PyTorch code. Here we will construct a randomly initialized tensor.
import
torch
x
=
torch
.
rand
(
5
,
3
)
print
(
x
)
The output should be something similar to:
tensor([[0.3380, 0.3845, 0.3217],
        [0.8337, 0.9050, 0.2650],
        [0.2979, 0.7141, 0.9069],
        [0.1449, 0.1132, 0.1375],
        [0.4675, 0.3947, 0.1426]])
Additionally, to check if your GPU driver and CUDA/ROCm is enabled and accessible by PyTorch, run the following commands to return whether or not the GPU driver is enabled (the ROCm build of PyTorch uses the same semantics at the python API level
link
, so the below commands should also work for ROCm):
import
torch
torch
.
cuda

The install instructions here will generally apply to all supported Windows distributions. The specific examples shown will be run on a Windows 10 Enterprise machine
Python
Currently, PyTorch on Windows only supports Python 3.10-3.14; Python 2.x is not supported.
As it is not installed by default on Windows, there are multiple ways to install Python:
Chocolatey
Python website
If you decide to use Chocolatey, and haven’t installed Chocolatey yet, ensure that you are running your command prompt as an administrator.
For a Chocolatey-based install, run the following command in an administrative command prompt:
choco
install
python
Package Manager
To install the PyTorch binaries, you will need to use the supported package manager:
pip
.
pip
If you installed Python by any of the recommended ways
above
,
pip
will have already been installed for you.
Installation
pip
No CUDA
